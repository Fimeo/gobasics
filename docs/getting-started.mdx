# Getting Started with Go Basics

**Go Basics** is a collection of in-depth articles on Go internals, concurrency, the standard library, and best practices. Each article goes beyond surface-level explanations — you'll find runtime mechanics, Mermaid diagrams, and interactive code examples you can run directly in the browser.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello from Go Basics!")
}
```
